# Various in depth Machine Learning Project:
1. This repository provides an in-depth analysis of customer segmentation using various clustering algorithms:
   1.1 Data Preparation
     - Load and preprocess the customer data.
   1.2 Normalization
     - Normalize the features to ensure equal contribution.
   1.3 Clustering Algorithms
     - K-Means Clustering
     - Hierarchical Clustering
     - DBSCAN
2. Build a Regression Model in Keras
   2.A Build a baseline model
     - Use the Keras library to build a neural network with the following
   2.B Normalize the data
     - Repeat Part A but use a normalized version of the data
   2.C Increate the number of epochsC. Increate the number of epochs
     - Repeat Part B but use 100 epochs this time for training
   2.D Increase the number of hidden layers
     - Repeat part B but use a neural network with the following instead:
         - Three hidden layers, each of 10 nodes and ReLU activation function
